## Example Raw Notes

```markdown
# Sprint Planning - Nov 29

@sarah wants eval component done by dec 15
DEC: push auth to Q1, focus RAG instead
@mike worried about data pipeline - "could slip 2 weeks"
! budget still not approved - blocking hiring
TODO @me update data team on timeline change
? why did we skip dashboard - seemed important before
>> follow up with alice on budget status
~~ thought we were doing auth first, changed

## My gut feel
Good alignment on priorities. Mike seems stressed about pipeline.
```

## Pro Tips for Voice Notes

1. **Speak naturally** - Just describe what happened, AI will structure it later.

2. **Name names** - "Sarah said..." not just "someone mentioned..."

3. **Say decisions out loud** - "We decided to do X because Y"

4. **Note your questions** - "I'm not sure why we're doing Z"

5. **Capture your gut feel** - "The meeting felt tense" or "Good alignment"

6. **Don't worry about structure** - Just get it down, AI cleans up later.

## Pro Tips for Written Notes

1. **3-Second Rule** - If it's important, write it within 3 seconds.

2. **Capture decisions as spoken** - "Let's do X" = decision. Write it down.

3. **Name everything** - `@mike: pipeline risk` not just `discussed risk`

4. **Write your questions** - If confused, write `? [question]`.

5. **Post-meeting dump** - After meeting, spend 2 min adding what you remember.
