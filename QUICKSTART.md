## Step 1: Set Your Goals (2 min)

Open `GOALS.md` and fill in:

```markdown
### Current Priorities
1. [Your #1 focus right now]
2. [Your #2 priority]
3. [Your #3 priority]

### Strategic Context
- **Role:** [Your role, e.g., "Senior PM, Payments Team"]
- **Product:** [What you're building]
```

This helps AI understand what matters to you.

## Step 2: Take Your First Note (1 min)

After your next meeting, create a new file in `Raw notes/`:

**Filename:** `2024-12-04 - Team standup.md`

**Content:** Just dump your thoughts. Example:
```
quick standup with the team
@sarah says auth component is on track for friday
@mike worried about API rate limits - might need to revisit
DEC: we're skipping the dashboard for v1, focusing on core flow
TODO: I need to update the PRD with the new scope
meeting felt good, team is aligned
```

That's it. Messy is fine.

---

## Step 3: Process Your Notes (1 min)

Tell your AI assistant:

> **"Process my meeting notes"**

AI will:
- ✅ Read your raw notes
- ✅ Extract decisions, updates, stakeholder info
- ✅ Update files in `Knowledge/Context/`
- ✅ Save enriched version to `Archive/`
- ✅ Ask clarifying questions if needed

---

## Step 4: Repeat

That's the whole system:

```
📝 Take notes → 🤖 Process → 📚 Knowledge grows
```

After 5-10 meetings, start asking:
- "What did we decide about [topic]?"
- "Prep me for my meeting with [person]"
- "What should I focus on today?"

## Pro Tips

### On Your Phone
- Use Obsidian mobile + iCloud sync
- Voice dictation works great — just talk
- Don't worry about formatting

### Shorthand Cheat Sheet
```
DEC:  = Decision made
@name = Person
TODO  = Action item
?     = Question/unclear
!     = Important
RISK  = Blocker
>>    = Follow-up needed
```

### Best Practices
- Process notes same day (fresher context)
- Mention people by name ("@sarah" not "someone")
- Capture your gut feel ("meeting felt tense")
