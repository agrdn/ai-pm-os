# Ongoing Threads

Recurring topics, unresolved issues, and conversations that span multiple meetings.

## Why Track Threads?

Some things don't get resolved in one meeting. They come up again and again.
Tracking threads helps you:
- Notice patterns ("This is the 4th time this came up")
- Ensure follow-through ("We said we'd address this - did we?")
- Prepare better ("This topic will probably come up again")
